## How to use

### Opening the tool

To start using the tool:

1. Go to the **Layout** tab (on the top bar).

2. Display the panels with additional options to the right of the view (using the **N** key).

3. In the bar that appears, select the **AI Animation Bridge** tab. You should see a panel with various options and a **Generate frames** button at the bottom.

It is also possible to use the plugin via the context menu on the timeline. To do this:

1. Make sure that you are in the **Layout** tab and that you can see the expanded timeline view at the bottom of the window. 
    - To expand the timeline view, hover the cursor over the space between the scene and the top edge of the timeline bar. Then press the **left mouse button** and move up the screen as desired.

2. Place the cursor inside the timeline view and open the context menu (using the **right mouse button**). You should see additional items such as **Generate frames**, **Generation options**, etc.

### Generating animation

1. While in the **Layout** tab, select the desired 3D object.

2. In the top left corner, change the mode to **Pose mode**.

3. Select all bones of the skeleton (most conveniently using the **left mouse button** on the scene).

4. Open the tool options
    - If you are using the context menu, select **Generation options**.

5. Select the AI model from the list and then configure the model and generation options.

6. Select the start and end frames of the animation to be generated
    - If you are using the context menu, move the cursor outside the options window and, holding down the **Shift** key, select both keyframes on the timeline.

7. Press the **Generate frames** button.

## Project Structure

- **/interface** -> contains the main interface that models must implement

- **/src** -> contains source files, including main_addon_file.py

- **/models** -> contains pre-prepared models that can be used. Each model has its own folder, with a file named model_name.py located directly within the folder, which implements our interface 

- **/sample_bvh_files** -> sample motion capture files

- **/lib** -> contains binary files required for the plugin


## Running tests
1. Install the plugin and run it in Blender at least once to install the necessary libraries

2. Install **pytest** and **pytest-blender** libraries in your Python installation

3. Run command **pytest --blender-executable <blender-executable-path>** in the **src/test folder**
